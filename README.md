# Crop-prediction-using_Ml

 ### Overview


The Crop Yield Prediction project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict crop yields based on various environmental, soil, and agricultural factors. This project aims to help farmers, agricultural scientists, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to maximize crop production and improve sustainability.

### Dataset


The dataset used in this project includes various features that influence crop yield, such as weather conditions, soil properties, and farming practices. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize continuous variables, and encode categorical features to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
The data underwent thorough preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and feature selection. Techniques such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical data were applied to prepare the data for model training.

### Model Building:
Several machine learning models were built and evaluated to determine the best model for predicting crop yield. Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were explored. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.

### Model Evaluation: 
The models were evaluated using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² Score. The best-performing model was selected based on its ability to accurately predict crop yields on the test data.

### Results
The model achieved a high level of accuracy in predicting crop yields, with an R² score of 97%, indicating that it effectively captures the relationship between the input features and the crop yield. The model provides valuable insights that can help in making informed decisions about crop management.

### Conclusion
The Crop Yield Prediction project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in the agricultural sector to optimize crop production. Future improvements could include incorporating more diverse datasets, exploring deep learning models, and developing a user-friendly interface for broader accessibility.
